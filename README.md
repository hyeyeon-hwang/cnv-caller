# cnv-caller
This cnv caller detects large-scale variation in low coverage whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data using two methods. The difference between the methods is that the first involves the user to input a bin size (e.g. 5000) to be used in the estimation of the copy number of each bin while the second involves a hidden Markov model (HMM).
